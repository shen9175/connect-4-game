This is a homebrew pc game connect4 with adversarial search: minimax algorithm. 
The game is built on Microsoft XNA and C# language.

The minimax search is only partial search of the whole solution tree
due to exponential calulation complexity. The AI move is based on self made up move-score-evaluation system
plus some tree pruning forsimplication of the whole calculation.
So AI will not make all the optimal move every time.

The AI performance is pretty good, between significate slow with higher AI and faster with lower AI,
I adjust it to some point of balance. The AI level can beat rookie level of human.
